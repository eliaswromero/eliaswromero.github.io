## **Questions**



### What are the Null and Alternative Hypotheses?
The null hypothesis is that bees in general are beneficial to the environment for their role in the pollination of crops and flowers. The alternative hypothesis is that non-native bee species can have negative impacts on native pollinators by reducing worker size which would reduce colony success, and facilitating the spread of non-native weed species.


### Who is collecting and analyzing this data?
Scientists David Goulson and Kate R. Sparrow.

### What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?
These two scientists took their own data. First, they counted 5 different species of bumblebees (including honeybees) at 100 different sites, at 4 km intervals in a 40x40 km square. They also took approximately 10 workers of the *B. lapidarius* and *B. pascuorum* and approximately 20 of the other two species (because the *B. terrestris* and *B. lucorum* species are difficult to distinguish), freezekilled them, and measured their thorax widths at the widest point.

### Why are they interested in this data?

Bees produce honey, which provides a lot of economic benefits to some people. Because of this, there is reluctance to say that bees are damaging to the environment. However, the two scientists want to show that non-native bee species negatively impact native pollinators.


### What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
The data being recorded is a count of 4 species of native bumblebees, and a count of honeybees as well. In some areas there are honeybees present, and in others there is not. Then, the average thorax widths of each native species were taken twice, with and without the presence of honeybees in their areas. Some data that is left out that I think could be important (although it would be a very difficult process) is quantifying the honey produced, to get the most accurate data to answer the hypothesis.


### What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

These scientists use the data to claim that there are less native bee species when honeybees co-exist in that same area.


### How was this study funded?
While it doesn't explicitly say anywhere in the paper where the study was funded, it mentions that that this study was part of a larger research paper to be published elsewhere, so I assume that funding came from the broader resource that funded the larger paper. However, it does not provide any links or info about the larger resource paper which leaves us in the dark.


### Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?
I believe that publish or perish did not have an effect on this specific study, because upon further research, both Sparrow and Goulson have published many other articles before this one on honeybee and pollination-related topics, so I don't think there was a lot of urgency and pressure to publish this article.
